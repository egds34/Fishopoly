To install, run install.bat as administrator. this changes your path variabl so the the forward dlls know where to look for the module dlls. If this fails. right-click and inspect 
how to change the environment variable manually. An alternative would be to install imageMagick itself which you can locate here:
https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php

Im sorry about this.
